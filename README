freestream-milne simulates the solution of the collisionless Boltzmann Equation assuming
that the particles are massless and that the initial distribution function is isotropic in azimuthal momentum space (px, py), and the initial distribution function
has a gaussian form in (y - eta), or thermally smeared boost invariant profile.
Given an intial energy density profile, it computes the stress energy tensor at a later time, in terms of a standard viscous hydro decomposition.

openMP is used to accelerate the computation by default.

On OSX 10.12, clang does not support -fopenmp by default, and one can update gcc to support -fopenmp
In this case one should call 'gcc-x' as the compiler in the Makefile, where gcc-x is the updated version with openMP support (this is usually installed in /usr/local/bin, so this must be added to PATH)

On Linux, one can change the Makefile to call their c++ compiler with -fopenmp support.

openacc (GPU) acceleration is under development, and is not yet functional
